# Vietnamese License Plate Recognition

This project implements an end-to-end **Vietnamese License Plate Recognition (VLPR)** system using **YOLOv11** for license plate detection and **PaddleOCR** for text recognition.

The system supports both common Vietnamese license plate formats:
- Single-line plates
- Two-line plates

## Model Fine-tuning

The YOLOv11 detection model was fine-tuned on a Vietnamese license plate dataset to improve localization accuracy under real-world conditions.

### Dataset:
